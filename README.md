Hey guys! We'll be using this repository to host our CSS on so we don't have to CONSTANTLY use a beautifier/compressor. When you save code after working on it for awhile, you save it on here as well. Our code will always be sexy. Use "Low" compression on http://www.codebeautifier.com/. I also want to comment all of the code. 

Don't feel pressured to use this too much in the beginning. Repos are weird to get used to.
